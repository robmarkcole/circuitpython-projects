# Photoresistor

* Project that plots photocurrent signal, with LED switching colour between light and darkness.
* https://learn.adafruit.com/photocells/circuitpython
* Photoresistor and 10kh resistor
* Issues? Connections aren't very strong, wobbling the photoresistor is enough to break the circuit

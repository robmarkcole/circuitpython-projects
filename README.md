# circuitpython-projects
circuitpython projects for demo/education. Requirements are imported manually from https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle (download the zipped latest release).

I recommend using [mu](https://github.com/mu-editor/mu) editor as it is ideal for fast iteration of the code. I normally would use vscode, and you can, but you will spend a lot of time reconnecting to the device with `screen` which really slows the development process.

## Photoresistor
A photoresistor is used to detect light/darkness, and toggle an LED colour. The signal from the photoresistor is plotted in real time by Mu.
